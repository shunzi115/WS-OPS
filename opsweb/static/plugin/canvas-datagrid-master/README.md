Installation
------------

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-datagrid)

    npm install canvas-datagrid


With [bower](https://libraries.io/bower/canvas-datagrid)

    bower install canvas-datagrid


Place the single source file `./dist/canvas-datagrid.js` in your web page using
a script tag that points to the source or use webpack.

    <script src="dist/canvas-datagrid.js"></script>

Alternatively, instead of downloading and installing, you can link directly to an NPM CDN like [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com).

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/canvas-datagrid"></script>


A function will be added to the global scope of the web page called `canvasDatagrid` as well as module loader definitions.

Getting started
---------------

Works [with webpack](https://tonygermaneri.github.io/canvas-datagrid/tutorials/amdDemo.html), [without webpack](https://tonygermaneri.github.io/canvas-datagrid/tutorials/demo.html) or as a [web component](https://tonygermaneri.github.io/canvas-datagrid/tutorials/webcomponentDemo.html).
No matter how you load it, `canvasDatagrid` is declared in the global scope.

Canvas-datagrid is a [Web Component](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/TonyGermaneri/canvas-datagrid) when
in a compatible browser, otherwise it is a `<canvas>` tag.

Using pure JavaScript
---------------------

    var grid = canvasDatagrid();
    document.body.appendChild(grid);
    grid.data = [
        {col1: 'row 1 column 1', col2: 'row 1 column 2', col3: 'row 1 column 3'},
        {col1: 'row 2 column 1', col2: 'row 2 column 2', col3: 'row 2 column 3'}
    ];


Using web component
-------------------

<!--
```
<custom-element-demo>
  <template>
    <script src="https://tonygermaneri.github.io/canvas-datagrid/dist/canvas-datagrid.debug.js"></script>
    <div style="height: 300px;"><next-code-block></next-code-block></div>
  </template>
</custom-element-demo>
```
-->


    <canvas-datagrid class="myGridStyle">[
        {"col1": "row 1 column 1", "col2": "row 1 column 2", "col3": "row 1 column 3"},
        {"col1": "row 2 column 1", "col2": "row 2 column 2", "col3": "row 2 column 3"}
    ]</canvas-datagrid>

* [XHR data paging demo](https://tonygermaneri.github.io/canvas-datagrid/tutorials/xhrPagingDemo.html) - Jeopardy Questions API.  Thanks to [jservice](http://jservice.io/) for the use of the free paging API.  Note: you must "load unsafe scripts" or relevant command to allow HTTPS (github) to make XHR requests to HTTP (Jeopardy Questions API).  There is nothing unsafe about this.

* [Sparkline example](https://tonygermaneri.github.io/canvas-datagrid/tutorials/sparklineDemo.html)

* [Pivot-form integration example](https://tonygermaneri.github.io/canvas-datagrid/tutorials/pivotFormDemo.html) - [pivot-form](https://github.com/TonyGermaneri/pivot-form) is the companion library to canvas-datagrid.  Where canvas-datagrid is a focused on large datasets, pivot-form is focused on a single row of data, providing rich UI abstractions such as dialogs, tabs, split-containers and more to present your schemas without the need to write complex UI interactions.
